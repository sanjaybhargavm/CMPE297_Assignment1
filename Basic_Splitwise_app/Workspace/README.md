The application will be a simple GUI application using Python's built-in `tkinter` library. The core classes and functions will be:

1. `SplitwiseApp`: This is the main class for the application. It will handle creating the GUI and processing user input.
2. `calculate_split`: This is a method in the `SplitwiseApp` class. It will take the total amount and the number of people as input, calculate the split, and update the GUI with the result.

The application will consist of a single Python file, `splitwise.py`.
